# Supply-Chain-Management-System
In this project we design an application to calculate the cheapest combination of available inventory items that can be used to fill a specific order. For example, if in a university, a faculty needs one executive chair, the application should be able to calculate the most cost-effective way of assembling the chair from other used furniture items. Perhaps one used chair only has usable legs and cushion foam, but another has a usable seat and arms. Together they can be used to create a new chair based on the costs of usable and available components. Faculties should be able to order the suggested items. If the needed components are available, an order form should be generated and the furniture items should be removed from inventory. In addition to the financial benefits for the university, there are environmental benefits to reusing furniture: reuse prevents perfectly functional goods from ending up in the landfill, while conserving resources and materials required to manufacture brand new furniture. Ultimately, achieving this goal will help the environment while saving money, time and energy!
